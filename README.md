# object-detection-using-ssd-on-construction-sites
Using SSD for object detection on construction sites.
Many use techniques and approches and technique has been introduced since the ssd have been introduced which can improve the traning and prediction. 
In this repository I am improving the SSD approch using better approches like using data agumentation, cyclyic learning rate, building better model architecture and other methods and techniques.
